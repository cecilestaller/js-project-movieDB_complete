# Movie Database

- Within the film database you can search for films by title, year of release, duration, director, genre and rating.
- You can also sort the database. Either ascending or descending by year of release or by the best rating.
- With this project I have learned to combine and use different loop and string methods.
- I mainly worked with the array methods filter(), forEach(), and sort()
